##Setup
1. Make sure you are using Eclipse Luna and that it is configured to use Java 8.
  1. Download [Eclipse here](https://eclipse.org/)
  2. Download [Java 8 here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
  3. Make sure that Eclipse is configured correctly. `Eclipse->Preferences->Java->Compiler` should show a "Compiler compliance level" of 1.8 and `Installed JREs` should show Java SE 8. See the professor TA if you need help with this.
2. Install either [Github for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or [Github for Windows](https://windows.github.com/). If you are a Linux user, feel free to use the command line. There are lots of other equivalent tools, but we'll help you out with these. Eclipse also has some integrated support, but you will need to do a few things that aren't easy to do with Eclipse directly. Get used to the command line or a separate tool.
