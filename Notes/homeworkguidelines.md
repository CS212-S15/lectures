Homework Guidelines
===================

##Submission
To submit your homework assignment, make sure the latest versions of *all* Java files are available on Github by the due date.

Homework assignments are due at 11:59pm on the due date.

Follow the [instructions for using Github](githubinstructions.md) to make sure you have uploaded your code correctly.

Use the Github website to make sure you see the latest version of your code there.

Once your code is up on Github, your assignment is officially submitted!

##Testing
To be eligible for full credit, your homework solution must pass all of the tests provided in the repository. You *may* receive some partial credit for partially working solutions, but this applies to homework assignments only.
